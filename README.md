## Project Instructions

https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/build-a-library-manager

*From Treehouse:* 

You've been tasked with creating a library management system for a small library. The librarian has been using a simple sqlite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to handle the library's books, patrons and loans.

You'll be given static HTML designs, a set of requirements and the existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website in Express and a SQL ORM, Sequelize.

## Technologies

* Node.js
* Express
* SQL
* Sequelize
* Pug
